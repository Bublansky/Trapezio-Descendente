# Trapézio Descendente

Trapézio Descendente is an Android game developed using Unity engine by two students from the State University of Amazonas in 2016.

The game is inspired by a video created by the Brazilian bodybuilder Kleber "Bambam".

In the video, Bambam is at the gym and during training starts screaming several funny phrases like 'the monster is leaving the cage!!!', 'is 37 years old, fuck', 'fucking show time!' and 'BIRLLLL'.
